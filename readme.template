# PinIO - Arduino pin management in javascript

This is a simple node.js library for controlling multiple arduino boards and groups of pins. This is intended to be a fairly low-level library that exposes an API which makes lower-level management of Arduino pins easier.

### Beginners

Beginners with arduino would be better off looking at the excellent Johnny-Five Library: https://github.com/rwldrn/johnny-five. This library will abstract away a lot of pain points of dealing with pesky bits.

### Installation

```
npm install pinio
```

<<examples>>

### Board API

After initialization, the ready event will be fired with several board objects. A board object may create a pin wrapper with the following commands:

```
var myLed = board.pins(12)
var myGroup = board.pins(8, 9)
```

### Pin API

Each pin group has shortcut methods.

* pin.output() - Sets the pin to output mode
* pin.high() - digital high
* pin.low() - digital low
* pin.pulse() - for things like IR sensors
* pin.write() - analog signals
